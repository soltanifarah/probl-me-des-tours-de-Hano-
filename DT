description 
The task is to solve a generalization of the classic Towers of Hanoi problem,
with six pegs and n disks of different sizes. The objective is to move all the disks to the sixth peg, 
while obeying the following rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, a disk can only be placed on a peg if it is 
either empty or its top disk is larger than the one being moved, and the goal is to minimize the number of moves required.
The problem is to be solved for n=6 to n=15, with several search techniques:

Breadth-first search
Depth-first and its biderctional search
A* heuristic search,
with a heuristic function h that combines the number of disks above each disk on pegs 1-5, 
the number of disks not immediately above the current disk on each peg, and the number of disks above each misplaced disk on the sixth peg.
The heuristic function is defined as h = a + 3b + c, where a, b, and c are the measures described above. 
All techniques should be implemented using bidirectional search.
